## Vision Statement
Scrawl is a mobile app that enables users to anonymously post messages at their location on a map. Other users would then be able to see these messages on their own map. This allows for very specific and convenient one-way communication. How it works is someone opens the app when they want to let others know something (e.g. broken printer, venue change, speed monitoring, traffic, etc.), then they can type out their message and post it at that location, which they can then see on a map. This will solve the problem of arriving at a venue, restaurant, or whatever it may be, just to find out it’s closed. This app will allow users to find out information about their local hot spots near them, adjust routes to work due to traffic, use a different printer, and overall to give the user some more specifics about the electronics and places around them. Other users will be able to view this message from anywhere (with optional filtering), but can positively or negatively rate these messages if they are present at the location of the message. Users can also report messages for inappropriate/inaccurate language or messages. At any time, the message creator can edit or delete their message from anywhere. If there are a lot of positive reactions, then the message will stay up longer than the default time. However, if a message reaches 24 hours it will automatically be deleted. During the time a message is up, a timestamp will be present to inform other users when messages were posted.


  Scrawl is targeted towards the Calvin community, but could theoretically be used by anyone, anywhere. The goal of Scrawl is to inform others about problems or changes around campus in order to save them from spending time discovering the same issues. Currently, there is no good solution for this. Being able to open up the map and look for a working printer or check if a venue is closed saves the time of having to walk there and be disappointed it's closed. Emailing all the students, faculty, and staff about small issues would be overwhelming and annoying, putting issues on Calvin’s website would be difficult to navigate and even harder to edit and update, and putting issues on bulletin boards would take way too long and would not reach enough people. It was because of the lack of communication tools for specific notifications around campus that Scrawl was inspired. It is similar to the app Waze where you can post traffic, construction, police, and crashes onto a map for others to see, but Scrawl will let you customize your messages, giving it far greater versatility to give awareness to users about the world around them.
