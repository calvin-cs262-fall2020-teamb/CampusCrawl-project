## Vision Statement

Campus Crawl is a mobile app that provides users a tour of Calvin University's campus. It gives the user a path that goes throughout the campus hitting all the main spots. On that path, there are several marked locations where the user can view a message left at that location, but only when the user is near the location. At that marked location, there will be information about the building/spot which was added by an administrator. An administrator has the ability to change the message shown at the marked point. The administrator only has to enter a password to get access to edit the message. Furthermore, the tour doesnâ€™t reveal the next destination until the user interacts with the currently shown marked location. There will also be a progress bar showing the user how far along they are on the tour.

The goal of Campus Crawl is to give a tour of campus that is self-paced, allowing the user (students/parents/anyone) to take themselves and/or their family and friends on a tour at their desired pace. Allowing those users to adapt better to campus. Currently, there is only one option for a tour, while Campus Crawl opens up another option. Being able to open up the app and hit the main spots on campus while also receiving pertinent information about the various spots.

While Calvin's official tours are beneficial, some people adapt to new surroundings differenlty. And others might choose to be adventurous and explore campus on their own, but still learning helpful information. Additionally, college is a big decision and a college's campus is a major factor in that decision. Campus Crawl provides the opportunity for the user to adapt to a new environment at their pace as well as providing the same services that Calvin official tours offer (like building information, insider hints).
