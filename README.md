# Campus Crawl

## Vision Statement

More often than not, new or visiting students find it difficult to navigate Calvin University's campus. Currently, the only solutions to this is to use a tour guide, try and use a paper map or image of Calvin's campus, or use Google Maps. Campus Crawl, however, introduces a new solution. Campus Crawl is a mobile app that provides users a tour of Calvin University's campus. It gives the user a path that goes throughout the campus hitting all the main spots. On that path, there are several marked locations where the user can read about that location when they approach it. The information that the user sees is controlled by an administrator, who must enter a password to make changes. This ensures that the information given is reliable, up-to-date, and secure. The goal behind Campus Crawl is to give the user (students/parents/anyone) and/or their family and friends a self-paced and stress-free tour of campus so that they can learn the layout of Calvin's campus and all Calvin has to offer. This provides the opportunity for the user to adapt to a new environment at their own pace while still providing the same services that Calvin official tours offer (like building information, insider hints).

The advantage of Campus Crawl over a traditional tour guide is the fact that it is self-paced. Often, tour guides are on a tight schedule so their stops are usually brief. Campus Crawl, on the other hand, encourages users to take their time and explore as much as they want. This creates a more enjoyable experience for the user and allows them to see parts they wouldn't otherwise have time for. The advantage of Campus Crawl over a campus image is obvious. Campus Crawl tells you where you are and where to go, while also giving very useful information. Similarly, using Google Maps to navigate campus may mark your location, but not all of the builings are marked and it does not give any helpful information.
